Welcome to SpikeRNN's documentation!
============================================

SpikeRNN is a PyTorch framework for constructing functional spiking recurrent neural networks from continuous rate models, based on the framework from Kim et al. (2019) (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905926116). 

The framework provides two complementary packages:

* **rate**: Continuous-variable Rate RNN package for training models on cognitive tasks
* **spiking**: Spiking RNN package for converting rate models to biologically realistic networks
